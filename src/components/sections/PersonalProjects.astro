					Programming language Interpreter
				</p>
				<p class="text-neutral-200">
					I implemented a programming language from scratch because I
					wanted to learn about the Lisp programming language. I had
					heard that it was relatively easy to implement, so after a
					long time spent building and learning about parsing and
					interpreters, I finally built it. I've learned a lot about
					how they work, and it was very enjoyable! I've also made a
					tutorial for people to learn how to use it. I really
					recommend that you try it.

					I used to save my passwords in a .txt file in plain text on
					my own computer, without any encryption. I could have used a
					third-party app, but I thought it was a very good
					opportunity to solve this problem by building my own
					software. This app encrypts all the information and lets you
					download the data in a JSON file. It is "secure", and I use
					it every day.
